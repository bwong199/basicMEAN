This is a basic app I made with the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js) with the help from the noted book. 

Key features include:  1) Passport.JS's authentication function. 
                        To get the Facebook one-click login to work, you have to go app> config> env, and put in your personal Facebook Developer cliendID and ClientSecret. 
                        https://developers.facebook.com/
                        This is the link where you can get your account. 
                        Twitter and Google one-click login are also setup, but you have to use your own account. 
                        
                        2) Group chat using Socket.io 
                        
                        3) basic CRUD
